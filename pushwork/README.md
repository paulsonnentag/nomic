# pushwork

_Bidirectional directory synchronization using [Automerge](https://automerge.org/) CRDTs._

pushwork turns any directory into a synchronized, conflict-free replicated folder. Initialize a directory to get a shareable `automerge:` URL, hand that URL to another machine (or another person), and `clone` it. From then on, `sync` reconciles both working trees through a WebSocket relay — concurrent edits, additions, deletions, and renames all converge automatically because every file is backed by an Automerge document.

It feels a bit like Git, but the "merge" is a CRDT: there are no merge conflicts to resolve by hand, and character-level edits to text files combine cleanly.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>= 24`
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) `>= 8`

## Installation

### From npm (recommended)

```sh
npm install --global pushwork
# or run it without installing:
npx pushwork <command>
```

This puts `pushwork` on your PATH. The examples below assume that.

### From source

```sh
git clone <repo-url> pushwork
cd pushwork
pnpm install
pnpm build        # compiles TypeScript to dist/
```

This produces the `pushwork` binary at `dist/cli.js`. You can then either:

```sh
node dist/cli.js <command>      # run directly
pnpm start -- <command>         # via the start script
pnpm link --global              # expose `pushwork` on your PATH
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The compiled `dist/` is what the CLI runs (and what the tests exercise), so build before running from source.

## Quick start

```sh
# Machine A — turn a directory into a pushwork repo
cd ~/notes
pushwork init
pushwork url            # prints the automerge: URL to share

# Machine B — clone that URL into a new directory
pushwork clone automerge:2sX...e9 ~/notes-clone

# On either machine, after editing files
pushwork sync           # exchange changes with peers and merge to disk

# Inspect local changes before syncing
pushwork status
pushwork diff
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pushwork init [dir]` | Initialize pushwork in a directory (default `.`). |
| `pushwork clone <url> <dir>` | Clone an `automerge:` URL into a directory. |
| `pushwork sync` | Sync local changes with peers and merge remote changes to disk. |
| `pushwork save` (alias `commit`) | Commit local changes to local storage without contacting the server. |
| `pushwork status` | Show changes against the saved state. |
| `pushwork diff [path]` | Show textual diffs of local changes; optionally limit to `path`. |
| `pushwork url` | Print the `automerge:` URL of this repo. |
| `pushwork heads [pathspec]` | Print Automerge heads for the root folder and every file doc (offline). |
| `pushwork yoink <url> [path]` | Pull a single file doc by URL and write it to disk (default path: the doc's own name). |
| `pushwork yeet <path> <url>` | Push a single file from disk into the file doc at `url`, mutating it in place. |
| `pushwork migrate [dir]` | Upgrade an older `.pushwork/config.json` to the current format. |
| `pushwork cut [name]` | Stash working-tree changes and reset the tree to the saved state (offline). |
| `pushwork paste [id-or-name]` | Re-apply a stashed change set (default: most recent). |
| `pushwork snarfs` (alias `clipboard`) | List stashed change sets, newest first. |
| `pushwork version` | Print pushwork and Automerge package versions. |

### Global options

These apply to every command:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--porcelain` | Machine-readable output: tab-separated lines, no spinners/colors/prompts. |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress progress; show only results and errors. |
| `--silent` | Suppress all output except errors (check the exit code). |
| `-v, --version` | Print version info and exit. |

### `init` / `clone` options

| Flag | Applies to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--shape <shape>` | both | Document shape: `vfs` (default), `patchwork-folder`, or a path to a custom shape module. |
| `--artifact-dir <dir>` | both | Directory whose text content is stored atomically (never character-merged). Repeatable. Defaults to `dist`. |
| `--no-sub` | both | Use the legacy WebSocket backend instead of Subduction. |
| `--legacy` | both | Alias for `--no-sub`. |

On `clone`, the shape is normally chosen from the root doc itself (`@patchwork.type` of `directory` → `vfs`, `folder` → `patchwork-folder`); `--shape` is only the fallback when the type isn't recognized.

### `sync` options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--nuclear` | Re-create every file/folder doc with a fresh URL before syncing, dropping references to the old URLs from this repo. |

## Sync backends

pushwork supports two WebSocket sync backends. **Subduction is the default.**

| Backend | Default endpoint | Selected by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subduction` | `wss://subduction.sync.inkandswitch.com` | default |
| `legacy` | `wss://sync3.automerge.org` | `--legacy` / `--no-sub` |

Override either endpoint with an environment variable:

```sh
PUSHWORK_SUBDUCTION_SERVER=wss://my-relay.example.com pushwork sync
PUSHWORK_LEGACY_SERVER=wss://my-relay.example.com pushwork sync --legacy
```

## Configuration

pushwork stores all of its metadata under `.pushwork/` at the repo root:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.pushwork/config.json` | Repo configuration (see below). |
| `.pushwork/storage/` | Automerge CRDT storage (`NodeFSStorageAdapter`). |
| `.pushwork/snarf/index.json` | Local stash entries (see [Stashing changes](#stashing-changes)). |

`config.json` is currently at version `5`:

```json
{
	"version": 5,
	"rootUrl": "automerge:2sX...e9",
	"backend": "subduction",
	"shape": "vfs",
	"artifactDirectories": ["dist"]
}
```

If the config version doesn't match the installed pushwork, commands fail with a prompt to run `pushwork migrate`.

### Ignore files

The following are always ignored: `.pushwork`, `.git`, and `node_modules`. Symlinks are skipped during traversal.

For anything else, add a `.pushworkignore` file at the repo root. It uses gitignore syntax (blank lines and `#` comments are ignored):

```gitignore
# .pushworkignore
*.log
tmp/
.env
```

### Pinned links

Every file and folder link inside the tracked tree is a heads-_pinned_ `automerge:` URL (`automerge:<docId>#<heads>`): it names the exact version that was last synced, so consumers reference a snapshot rather than a moving target, and syncing is also publishing — each sync re-pins every link at the heads it can see. Only the root folder URL (the repo's shared identity) stays bare. The pinned content is also the base for sync's three-way reconcile; see [`design/artifacts.md`](./design/artifacts.md) and [`design/sync.md`](./design/sync.md).

### Artifact files

Files marked as _artifacts_ are treated as build output: their text content is stored as an atomic immutable string that is replaced whole rather than character-merged. By default the `dist` directory is an artifact directory; configure the default list with `--artifact-dir <dir>` (repeatable) at `init`/`clone` time, which is recorded in `.pushwork/config.json` (local to your checkout).

#### `.pushworkattributes` (travels with the repo)

`--artifact-dir` only configures _your_ checkout. To make artifact rules travel with the repo so every collaborator agrees, add `.pushworkattributes` files. They're ordinary tracked files (synced like any other content) modeled on `.gitattributes`, and siblings to `.pushworkignore`:

```gitattributes
# .pushworkattributes
dist/**     artifact
build/**    artifact
*.wasm      artifact
vendored/   -artifact     # negate a default; last matching rule wins
```

Each line is `<glob> <attr>...` (blank lines and `#` comments ignored). Patterns are gitignore-style globs; the only attribute today is `artifact` (`-artifact` unsets it). An attributes file may sit in **any directory**: its patterns are relative to its own location and apply only to its subtree, with deeper files overriding shallower ones for the paths they match. When any attributes file is present, its `artifact` rules **override** `artifactDirectories` from `.pushwork/config.json`, and pushwork warns when the two disagree so a stale local config can't silently diverge from the repo.

## Document shapes

A _shape_ controls how the directory tree is encoded into Automerge documents.

| Shape | Value | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VFS _(default)_ | `vfs` | A single directory doc (`@patchwork.type: "directory"`) whose keys are posix file paths mapping to file-doc URLs. |
| Patchwork folder | `patchwork-folder` | A recursive folder-of-docs (`@patchwork.type: "folder"`) compatible with Patchwork and original pushwork repos. |
| Custom | _module path_ | A module with a `default` export implementing `{ encode, decode }`. |

Select a shape with `--shape` at `init`/`clone`.

## Stashing changes

pushwork has a local "clipboard" for working-tree changes — handy for setting aside in-progress edits. These stashes (called _snarfs_) are stored locally and are never synced.

```sh
pushwork cut "wip-refactor"   # stash changes, reset tree to saved state
pushwork snarfs               # list stashes (newest first)
pushwork paste                # re-apply the most recent stash
pushwork paste wip-refactor   # or re-apply a specific one by id or name
```

## Sharing a single file

`yoink` and `yeet` move one file doc around by URL, independent of any folder structure. Find a file's doc URL with `heads`, then pull or push it from anywhere:

```sh
pushwork heads notes/todo.md        # → notes/todo.md  automerge:abcd…  <heads>
pushwork yoink automerge:abcd        # write that doc to ./todo.md (its own name)
pushwork yoink automerge:abcd grabbed.md   # …or to an explicit path
pushwork yeet draft.md automerge:abcd      # overwrite the doc with draft.md
```

Both run inside an initialized repo (they use its backend and storage) and contact the sync server. `yoink` is detached: the file it writes is an ordinary working-tree file, not linked back to the source doc — a later `save` or `sync` tracks it under a fresh file doc like any other path. `yeet` mutates the target doc in place (text merges character-by-character; binary is last-writer-wins), so peers holding that URL see the change.

## How it works

A pushwork repo is a tree of Automerge documents. One _root folder doc_ (whose URL is what you share) references one _file doc_ per file. The folder URL is stable for the life of the repo, so sharing it once is enough.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["root folder doc<br/>(automerge: URL — this is what you share)"]
    A --> B["src/index.ts → file doc (pinned link)"]
    A --> C["README.md → file doc (pinned link)"]
    A --> D["dist/bundle.js → file doc (pinned link)"]
    A --> E["..."]
```

A `sync` performs a full round trip:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FS as Working tree
    participant PW as pushwork
    participant SRV as Sync server (WebSocket)
    FS->>PW: read files, honor ignore rules
    PW->>PW: diff against saved tree, write changes into file docs
    PW->>SRV: push/pull doc changes (Automerge merge)
    SRV-->>PW: peer changes
    PW->>FS: materialize merged tree back to disk
```

`save` (alias `commit`) runs the same pipeline _offline_ — it commits to local CRDT storage and never contacts a server.

## Migrating older repos

If you have a repo created by an older pushwork (or the original pushwork "main" repo with a `.pushwork/config.json` predating versioning), upgrade it in place:

```sh
pushwork migrate          # operates on the current directory
pushwork migrate ./repo
```

Migration walks the config forward one version at a time and reports the steps taken, or that the repo is already up to date.

## Programmatic API

The package also exposes a library API (`import` from `pushwork`). Functions that talk to the network accept `online: false` for fully offline operation.

```ts
import {init, clone, sync, save, status} from "pushwork"

// Initialize a repo
const {url, files} = await init({
	dir: "./my-project",
	backend: "subduction", // or "legacy"
	shape: "vfs",
})
console.log(`Initialized ${files} files at ${url}`)

// Clone it elsewhere
await clone({url, dir: "./clone-target", backend: "subduction", shape: "vfs"})

// Sync / inspect
await sync("./my-project") // online by default
await save("./my-project") // offline commit
const {diff} = await status("./my-project")
```

Configuration and migration helpers (`migrate`, `migrations`, `detectVersion`, `readRawConfig`, `CONFIG_VERSION`) and shape helpers (`vfsShape`, `patchworkFolderShape`, `pinUrl`, `stripHeads`, `isInArtifactDir`, `normalizeArtifactDir`) are exported as well.

Key option types:

```ts
type Backend = "legacy" | "subduction"

type InitOpts = {
	dir: string
	backend: Backend
	shape: string // "vfs" | "patchwork-folder" | module path
	artifactDirectories?: readonly string[] // default: ["dist"]
	online?: boolean // default: true
}

type CloneOpts = InitOpts & {
	url: string
	// optional interactive hooks for legacy "branches" / strategy docs:
	onBranchesDoc?: (info) => AutomergeUrl | Promise<AutomergeUrl>
	onStrategyDoc?: (info) => boolean | Promise<boolean>
}
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUSHWORK_SUBDUCTION_SERVER` | `wss://subduction.sync.inkandswitch.com` | Subduction sync endpoint. |
| `PUSHWORK_LEGACY_SERVER` | `wss://sync3.automerge.org` | Legacy WebSocket sync endpoint. |
| `PUSHWORK_WS_INLINE` | _off_ | Set to `1` to open the sync WebSocket on the main thread instead of a worker thread. |
| `DEBUG` | _off_ | Set `DEBUG=true` (rewritten to `DEBUG=*`) to enable `pushwork:*` debug logs. |

### Concurrency

pushwork runs a single Automerge `Repo` over one sync connection. The WebSocket (and its frame decoding) lives in a worker thread so a busy main thread never stalls reads or keepalives, and per-file document fetches during clone/pull are pipelined concurrently over that one connection. Every synced document sits under the same delivery check, so the final `SYNCED`/`PENDING` verdict covers the whole tree.
