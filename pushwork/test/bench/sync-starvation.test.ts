/**
 * Event-loop starvation guard for the ingest path.
 *
 * Ingesting a few thousand files makes `pushwork init`/`sync` run thousands
 * of small synchronous Automerge Wasm calls (doc creation, content splice,
 * directory mutation) back-to-back with only microtask awaits between them.
 * Without a macrotask yield, the loop is blocked in one unbroken stretch and
 * the macrotask queue (timers AND the sync server's socket/pong) is never
 * serviced — that starvation is what trips a sync server's keepalive and
 * surfaces as `request timed out`.
 *
 * This drives the offline bench (`bench/sync-bench.ts`) in a subprocess —
 * both to sidestep the Wasm/ESM dual-load that breaks under in-process
 * transpilers and to measure a real process's event-loop drift. The bench is
 * compiled to CommonJS (matching the shipped CLI) so the Subduction Wasm
 * loads as a single consistent instance under Node's `require(ESM)`.
 *
 * We assert `maxDriftMs` (the longest *single* block — the thing that misses
 * pongs), NOT `blockedFraction`: ingest is genuinely CPU-bound, so the
 * fraction stays high regardless; the question is only whether any one
 * synchronous stretch runs long enough to trip a sync server's keepalive.
 *
 * Gated behind PUSHWORK_BENCH=1 so normal CI stays fast:
 *   PUSHWORK_BENCH=1 npx vitest run test/bench/sync-starvation
